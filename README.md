team-dashboard
==============

Dashboard used to track team activity via bugzilla. It tracks public sec-moderate+ bugs, recently fixed bugs, and outstanding reviews.

This was written by Josh Aas, who is an admittedly poor web developer. All he's willing to say in its defense is "it basically works."

To do list:

1. Show the number of days each review request has been outstanding. Color code each review request by days outstanding - green for 0-2 days, orange for 3-4 days, red for 5+ days.
